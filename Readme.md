# Recrute.it

Recrute.it is a Django app for recruters to find candidates from github. (and from stackoverflow in the future) \

## Issues

* You can't make more than 30 request in 1 minute due to [Github's search api limitation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/search#rate-limit)
* App generally works so slow that I don't think I would implement the stackoverflow search functionality since it will require web scraping (which works slow).
